Terraform Provider GitHub (Cased fork)
=======================================

This is a fork of `terraform-provider-github`. It will be renamed shortly to remove confusion.

Existing documentation for the GitHub provider can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github). 
Future work will be on separate documentation, under that new name.

Roadmap
--------

We'll be working through the long list of issues in [github/terraform-provider-github](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github) and prioritizing.

We're focusing right now with the top issues identified by our rough metrics [here](https://github.com/cased/terraform-provider-github/blob/main/PRIORITY_ISSUES.md).
